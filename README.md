# AvalancheJS Scripts

These scripts are for testing [AvalancheJS](https://docs.avax.network/build/tools/avalanchejs)'s API. This includes [RPC tests](./rpc) and [transactions](./transactions).

See something which you'd like to change or bring to our attention? If so, please [create an issue](https://github.com/cgcardona/avalanchejs-scripts/issues). Want to add something or fix a bug? Thanks! Start by [creating a pull request](https://github.com/cgcardona/avalanchejs-scripts/pulls). If I see anything about your PR which needs to be updated then I'll add a review w/ requested changes as comments.

Before and after deploying a new build of AvalancheJS, manually run these tests and confirm everything is working properly.
